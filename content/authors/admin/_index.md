I'm a computer engineer interested in wireless communications, low power wide area networks, and IoT.

I obtained Ph.D. 2016 in Computer Engineering, the thesis studies about management of Wireless Access Controller in IEEE 802.11 networks. I have performed research studies about  LPWAN Networks, the de-facto communication standard for IoT, mainly LoRa/LoRaWAN networks. Also, I'm working on cellular technologies on mMTC and V2X in 5G networks.  

I am open to research cooperation with individuals and organizations related to wireless communication systems
 in such a case, feel free to contact me.
