I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Engineering in 2016. My thesis focused on managing Wireless Access Controllers in IEEE 802.11 networks. Since then, I have researched LPWAN Networks( which become a standard communication method for IoT), particularly LoRa/LoRaWAN networks. Recently, my studies have focused on Digital Twins, V2X Security, and IoT security.

I am open to research cooperation with individuals and organizations related to digital twins, wireless communication systems and security
