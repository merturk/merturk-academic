abstract: The Graph Signal Processing (GSP) is a mathematical framework that
  extends the Discrete Signal Processing (DSP) tools such as filtering and
  signals decomposition to graph data structures. In this paper, we explore the
  application of the GSP framework to distributed wireless sensor networks to
  reduce the measured noise and/or estimate the signal of missing sensors. The
  context is that of distributed monitoring applications, such as the monitoring
  of large buildings, such as hospitals, public areas and farmlands. Using
  simulation tools, we analysed the ability of GSP in reducing the noise and in
  estimating sensor's data in different WSN scenarios. We modelled the sensor
  networks as Graph structures and apply Graph Shift and Graph Laplacian
  operations on such graph signals. The analysis of obtained results shows that
  GSP may represent a valuable tool in the considered scenarios with outstanding
  performance.
