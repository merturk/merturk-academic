Digital Twin (DT) is a technology that creates a virtual replica of physical entities and processes for real-time analysis. DT approach enables what-if analysis over with high accuracy models that classic simulations cannot handle.

IoT (Internet of Things) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are crucial technologies that enable Digital Twin (DT) systems. In DT, a physical asset is replicated in real-time through two-way communication channels, while virtual models represent the asset virtually. AI and Machine Learning analyze the data generated by the virtual models.

DT systems are used in almost every sector, such as manufacturing, automotive, supply chain, architecture, construction, healthcare, retail, energy, education …etc.

The following paper, in which Fahim et al. describe wind turbine predictive maintenance modeling through digital twins, provides more detailed information.
